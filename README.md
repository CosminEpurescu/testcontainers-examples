# Testcontainers library main released features walk through

This repository contains a set of small projects that I use to showcase the most important features of testcontainers.

It goes from simple to complex and it uses a simple API written in spring as it's starting point.

Each project builds upon the previous one and introduces small changes to either the sources or the tests.
